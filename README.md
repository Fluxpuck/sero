<p>Welcome to the Sero GitHub Repository. Sero is a comprehensive Discord bot ecosystem built with TypeScript using the <a href="https://discord.js.org/">Discord.js</a> library. The project features a modular architecture with multiple packages that work together to provide moderation tools, user management, AI-powered interactions, and other helpful functionality for Discord servers.</p>

## Project Overview

Sero Bot is structured as a monorepo with three main packages:

### Packages

- **[Sero Bot](/packages/sero)**: Core Discord bot implementation with moderation tools, user management, and event handling
- **[Sero API](/packages/api)**: Backend service providing RESTful endpoints, database management, and scheduled tasks
- **[Sero Agent](/packages/agent)**: AI-powered Discord bot framework with OpenAI and Claude integration

## Features

- **Moderation System**: Ban, kick, timeout, warn, and other moderation tools
- **User Management**: Track user data, experience, economy, and more
- **Birthday System**: Track and celebrate user birthdays with automated messages
- **AI Integration**: Connect with OpenAI and Claude for intelligent responses
- **Image Generation**: Create and edit images using DALL-E models
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automated actions like birthday messages and reward drops
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage of user data and server settings
- **Redis Integration**: Caching and pub/sub messaging between services

## Architecture

The project uses a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **Discord Bot (Sero)**: Handles Discord interactions and commands
- **API Service**: Manages data persistence and business logic
- **Agent Service**: Provides AI-powered features and tools
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for persistent storage
- **Redis**: Message broker and caching layer
